# KOBU_v1
Repo of KOBU bot v1 

KOBU v1 features:

  1) ESP32 based MCU (Dev Module) with WiFi/BT Capabilities.
  2) 4 Front and Rear Sonic sensors with Addresable RGB LEDs integrated into the sensors wired Front and Back.
  3) 7.4V 18650 Li-ion Battery system with onboard USB charging module.
  4) Optional Line-tracking sensors with auto adaptive mode for Line tracking and Floor sensing.


KOBU is a simple Robot platform built upon a 4WD Chasis with 4 motors wired in 2 way parallel brige (Sides Skirt) to be powered and controlled by aa 2 channel Motor driver (L298). It's simplicity makes it easier to explore various algorithms for robotics without getting into complicated stuffs beforehand. Powerfull ESP32 is more than enough to integate RTOS (Real Time Operating System) and enhance the decision making abilities of the robot effectively.

Projects on KOBU v1:

  1) Bluetooth Controlled vehicle with Bluetooth RC App (Download from external sources on Android).
  2) 4 way Ultrasonic based obstacle avoiance and self exploratory Level 1 robot.
  3) WiFi webserver based remote control using ESP32 on-board WiFi mode.
  4) Hybrid Bluetooth RC with functional obstacle avoidance capabilites integration with RTOS.
  5) ROS2Arduino based ROS2 interface with Raspberry Pi extension. (Planned for v2)
